# My 100 Days of GPU Learning Journey

## About This Challenge

I am participating in the **100 Days of GPU Challenge**, an initiative inspired by the community at [hkproj/100-days-of-gpu](https://github.com/hkproj/100-days-of-gpu).

My personal goal for this challenge is to learn and master **Mojo ðŸ”¥**, a new programming language for all AI developers. I will be following the learning path provided by Modular through their interactive **[Mojo ðŸ”¥ GPU Puzzles](https://builds.modular.com/puzzles/introduction.html)**.

## My Goal

The objective is to consistently code and learn for 100 days, documenting my progress as I solve the puzzles and explore the capabilities of Mojo for GPU programming.

I will create a new folder for each day to store my code and learning notes.
